Task 0 : You can remove the entire last for loop in the code to make the extra unnecasarry files go away, and you parse the line with a task going and no waiting wrong which is why you get an extra file called TT=26 Schedule.....
Task 1-2 : Good job
Task 3 : You have some counting errors in the round robin task but looks like you just didnt take enough time to go through since your drawing and numbers dont match up

You should take a good look over the bash script and be sure you understand round robin but overall good enough, approved
