Remember that this is meant to run on linux, 
and the gradle run does not work on linux, you need 
./gradlew run. Also remember the #!/bin/bash at the 
begining of a shell file. Other than that the script works
as intended.  Task 3 is allright, maybe use differing 
colors when waiting and running the readability is not very
good
