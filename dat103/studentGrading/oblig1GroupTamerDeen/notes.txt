Task 0 : Great job, remember to double quote your $var to prevent problems
Task 1-2 : Good job
Task 3 : Some errors here, the processes after 5 have a later arrival time so they wont be before task 3 this causes some errors compounding through the task you do however seem to have understood, just be carefull about arrival times and counting correct. FCFS good

Overall good job, remember to take your time with counting over, you had the answers to this task in the test in task 2 so use that as a comparison and look over one more time, but approved.
